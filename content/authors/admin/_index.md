I'm a Ph.D. student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I got my bachelor degree in Physics at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/).
I am interested in understanding and controlling the non-equilibrium dynamics of correlated materials. My experimental techniques include nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy and multidimentional spectroscopy.
