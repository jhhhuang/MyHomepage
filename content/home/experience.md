experience:
#  - title: Simulation of AOM THz pulse shaping system
#    company: Supervised by Prof. [Zhensheng Tao](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/16/4b/c7605a136779/page.htm)
#    company_url: ''
#    location: Fudan University
#    date_start: '2022-06-01'
#    date_end: '2022-09-01'
#    description: |2-
#       * Developed a matrix method for Fresnel diffraction with higher accuracy, which can be used to simulate near-field geometric optics.
#       * Developed a simulation platform for AOM (acousto-optic modulators) pulse shaping system with arbitrary geometric setup.

  - title: Stabilization and Destabilization of Multimode Solitons in Nonlinear Degenerate Multi-Pass Cavities
    company: Supervised by Prof. [Zhensheng Tao](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/16/4b/c7605a136779/page.htm)
    company_url: ''
    location: Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-08-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
       * Using Floquet analysis and perturbation theory, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of the destabilization of optical solitons in nonlinear multi-pass cavities.
       * We indentify novel mode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium lengths, which facilitates soliton stabilization.

  - title: Solid state high-order sideband harmonic generation
    company: Supervised by Prof. [Zhensheng Tao](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/16/4b/c7605a136779/page.htm)
    company_url: ''
    location: Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-04-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
       * Studied the SFA (strong-field approximation) theory.
       * Helped with data measurement and data analysis.

#  - title: Blind FROG (Frequency Resolved Optical Gating) Algorithm
#   company: Supervised by Prof. [Zhensheng Tao](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/16/4b/c7605a136779/page.htm)
#    company_url: ''
#    location: Fudan University
#    date_start: '2021-05-01'
#    date_end: '2021-08-01'
#    description: |2-
#       * Implemented the Principle Component Generalized Projection Algorithm (PCGPA) and Ptychographic algorithm for Blind FROG.
#       * Introduced ramdom numbers to optimize the PCGPA Algotithm so that it's suitable for Blind FROG problems.
